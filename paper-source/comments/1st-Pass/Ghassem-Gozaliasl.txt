Hi David and Brooke,

 

Thank you for the excellent work. Unfortunately, I'm currently tied up with an NSF and RCF funding proposal and haven't had much time to thoroughly review the paper. I plan to read it as soon as possible, but in the meantime, please consider my comments for revision later:

 

A few quick comments on the abstract:

 

1. When you mention "at what point in interaction," could you clarify if you mean a specific timescale or phase?

2. Please add the redshift range of galaxies for clarity.

3. When stating "We select a sample of 4181...," could you explain the selection process? Perhaps mention if galaxies were selected and classified based on visual inspection.

4. You abbreviate "AGN activity" in line 7 but then use "active galactic nuclei" at the beginning of line 11.

 

Cheers,

Ghassem
